        # Implement your data loss prevention logic here
        # You can consider the following enhancements:

        # 1. Encryption:
        # Encrypt the data using a strong encryption algorithm.
        # Example: Use AES encryption with a secret key.

        # 2. Mask Sensitive Information:
        # Replace sensitive information (e.g., credit card numbers, SSNs) with placeholders.
        # Example: Replace all occurrences of credit card numbers with "**** **** **** ****".

        # 3. Validate Input:
        # Validate the input data to ensure it meets security requirements.
        # Example: Check if the data contains valid email addresses or URLs.

        # 4. Logging:
        # Log any suspicious activities or attempts to access sensitive data.
        # Example: Write log entries when data is accessed or modified.

        # 5. Access Control:
        # Implement access control mechanisms to restrict who can access the data.
        # Example: Use role-based access control (RBAC) or permissions.

        # 6. Error Handling:
        # Handle exceptions gracefully and provide informative error messages.
        # Example: Raise custom exceptions for specific security-related issues.

        # Feel free to customize and expand upon these suggestions based on your specific requirements.

        # Return the protected data (or the original data if no protection is applied)
        return data

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    dlp_instance = DLP()
    sensitive_data = "This is a credit card number: 1234-5678-9012-3456"
    protected_data = dlp_instance.prevent(sensitive_data)
    print("Protected data:", protected_data)
