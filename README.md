To clone the repository, use the following command:
git clone https://github.com/BinaryNinjaCyberSamurai/Poseidon-s-Trident.git

## Usage

To use **Poseidon's Trident**, you need to run the main script:


python PoseidonsTrident_Cybersecurity.py


This will launch the graphical user interface, where you can select the mode of operation:

- Threat Detection: This mode will scan your network and cloud infrastructure for potential threats, using various techniques such as firewall, intrusion detection system, threat intelligence, and vulnerability assessment.
- Protection: This mode will protect your network and cloud infrastructure from attacks, using various techniques such as encryption, authentication, authorization, data loss prevention, and security policy.
- Response: This mode will help you respond to incidents, using various techniques such as logging, incident response, threat detection advanced, and api security.

You can also use the command-line interface, where you can pass arguments to the script. For example:


python PoseidonsTrident_Cybersecurity.py --mode threat_detection --target 192.168.1.1


This will run the threat detection mode on the target IP address.

You can see the results of the analysis in the terminal or in the log file
